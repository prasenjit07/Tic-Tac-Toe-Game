This project was done under **Engage'2020** conducted by **Microsoft**.
Built an **unbeatable AI** Tic Tac Toe game using **minimax algorithm**.
We optimized the algorithm using **alpha-beta pruning**.
Alpha-beta pruning belongs to the **branch and bound** category.
* By using this we were able to *reduce* the **time complexity** as some branches of the tree can be eliminated using alpha beta pruning.
* Appropriate **heuristics** values were chosen for the code.
* Game has various **levels** given in the form of depths.
* Used **functional paradigm** for the code
* **Two human player** feature was also added.
